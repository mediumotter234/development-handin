    <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
    <p>I used React to develop a <a href="https://mediumotter234.github.io/development/">simple interactive interface</a> with components and state that allows users to browse and interact
        with a short collection of films, including the ability to sort, filter and aggregate. Specifically, the users have the 
        ability to filter by genre and rating (stackable), sort by recency of release date, and add to and remove from a
        watchlist which aggregates the total runtime of films in the watchlist.
    </p>

    <h3>DETAILS</h3>
    <p>
        I use two main components, a MovieItem component and a FilterOption component. The MovieItem component represents
        everything in each movie card item that's shown, and the FilterOption component describes each filter option provided.
        <br>
        <br>
        When the user selects or unselects any of the filtering options or sorting dropdowns, my app has onchange functions to
        handle these changes. In each of these functions, the result of the user's action is taken into account in setting the
        new state, whether it's unchecking a genre filter or selecting a sort option. Thus at any state, the app should know
        which genre filters are selected, which rating filter is selected, which sorting option is selected, and whether or not
        the watchlist option is selected.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once these changes are handled, every time the site is rendered, the app uses the new state to determine precisely which
        movies should be rendered based on the current state of the genre filters, rating filters, sort option, and watchlist
        option.
    </p>

    <h3> TAKEAWAYS </h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Building a simple yet functional website from the ground-up like this allowed me to get a good amount of practice
            understanding and using state for multiple purposes in React. While I only implemented a couple filter options and one sorting option, I have a better
            understanding of how something like this could be scaled up significantly for a much larger project.
